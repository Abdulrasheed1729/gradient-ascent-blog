Hey there, and welcome to Local Maxima — my little peak on the internet! I’m climbing the steep, twisty hill of learning, exploring robotics, AI, compilers and all the fascinating math that powers them. This blog is where I share the things I’m figuring out along the way — the small wins, the occasional plateaus, and the joy of getting a little less stuck each time. Grab your curiosity (and maybe a snack); we’re optimizing for growth, not perfection.
