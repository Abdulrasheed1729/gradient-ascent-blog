title: About Me

Hi! I’m Abdulrasheed - a mathematics graduate who began my career as a Flutter developer before discovering a deeper passion for robotics and intelligent systems. My interest sparked during a project on topological robotics, where I saw how abstract mathematics could guide real-world motion and decision-making.

Since then, I’ve explored the intersection of robotics, AI, and software development—tinkering with tools like ROS2, Flutter, and Rust to bring ideas to life. I’m currently a Google DeepMind Scholar at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, where I continue to learn, experiment, and prepare for the next steps in my journey into intelligent systems.
